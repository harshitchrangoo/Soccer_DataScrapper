# Soccer_DataScrapper

This is a repository that would enable the user to extract data from the football statistic platform www.understat.com
This platform has data of the top 5 european football leagues and gives us data from season 2014. 
Here, we extract this data and combine it. 

Later we would look to clean this data as I have observed that the player names get butchered upon scraping as some letters don't fall into the english alphabets.
We would look to create a dictionary and replace the letters as we encounter them so that the names could be written in English and closely relate to the native language.
Eg: *Sergio AgÃ¼ero* would become *Sergio Aguero* instead of _Sergio Agüero_.
